Chapter 3: A Framework for System Design Interviews

System design interviews evaluate how you approach building scalable, reliable, and maintainable systems. The goal isn't just the final architecture, but also your thought process, ability to ask questions, and how well you collaborate.

üß† Step-by-Step System Design Interview Framework


1. Clarify the Problem
   
      Ask for a clear feature list: "What exactly should the system do?"
      
      Clarify functional and non-functional requirements (availability, latency, consistency).
      
      Clarify scope: MVP vs. production-ready system.

2. Define Constraints and Assumptions

    Estimate:
      
      Number of users (DAUs/MAUs)
    
      Read vs write ratio
      
      Storage needs (data per user √ó users)
      
      QPS (Queries per Second) for reads/writes
      
      Write down all assumptions.

4. High-Level Design
   
   Present a bird‚Äôs-eye view of your system.
    
    Identify major components: API layer, service layer, database, cache, queue, CDN, etc.
  
    Sketch a basic block diagram (if possible).

5. Data Modeling (Optional if time allows)

    Define schema (tables, fields, relationships)
    
    Discuss how data is accessed, indexed, and sharded

6. Component Breakdown

    Start discussing each component in this order (unless directed otherwise):
    
    API gateway/load balancer
    
    Web/application servers
    
    Databases (SQL vs NoSQL, why?)
    
    Caching (Redis/Memcached, expiration policies)
    
    Asynchronous processing (message queues like Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS)
    
    CDN and static asset delivery
    
    Storage (e.g., S3, blob stores)


7. Scalability and Performance

    Horizontal vs vertical scaling
    
    Caching strategies: full-page, object-level
    
    Sharding, partitioning, replication
    
    Use read replicas, write masters, or multi-master setups

8. Bottlenecks & Trade-offs
   
    Identify the system‚Äôs weakest link under scale.
    
    What happens during:
    
    High traffic?
    
    Server failure?
    
    Data center outage?
    
    Discuss availability vs consistency (CAP theorem)

9. Reliability and Redundancy
   
    Use health checks, failover, and auto-scaling.
    
    Multiple data centers or availability zones.
    
    Backup and disaster recovery strategies.

10. Security Considerations

    Authentication & authorization (e.g., OAuth, JWT)
    
    Data encryption (at rest, in transit)
    
    Rate limiting, input validation, abuse detection

11. Monitoring and Metrics
    
    What to monitor: request latency, error rates, CPU/memory/disk
    
    Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Datadog, etc.
    
    Logging and alerting strategy


üìù Interview Best Practices


‚úÖ Do‚Äôs
    Ask clarifying questions before diving in.
    
    Communicate clearly and think out loud.
    
    Break down your thoughts into steps and draw diagrams when possible.
    
    Make realistic assumptions and state them.
    
    Focus on trade-offs in choices (e.g., SQL vs NoSQL).
    
    Show the evolution of the system ‚Äî from MVP to a scalable version.
    
    Be collaborative ‚Äî treat the interviewer like a teammate.

‚ùå Don‚Äôts


    Don‚Äôt jump into details too early.
    
    Don‚Äôt forget to consider edge cases or failure scenarios.
    
    Don‚Äôt ignore real-world constraints like cost, latency, and complexity.
    
    Don‚Äôt stay silent ‚Äî if you‚Äôre stuck, ask questions or talk through it.
    
    Don‚Äôt treat this like a coding problem ‚Äî this is architecture.
